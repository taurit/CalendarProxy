    <h1>Clean up your calendar view!</h1>

    <p>Sometimes you want to subscribe to a calendar, but would like to have <strong>more control of what events are displayed and how</strong>.</p>

    For example, if you use calendar exported from a TODO-list app, what you get is limited by app's data model. For example
    <strong>
        <a href="https://todoist.com/">Todoist</a>
    </strong> exports calendar in a way that all tasks are assumed to take exactly 1 hour, and if the time for the task is not specified, they are listed as all-day events. Another example, when you subscribe to <strong>Facebook events calendar</strong> in your calendar program, you might notice that some events you will receive last weeks or months, and clutter your calendar view even though you are not interested
</p>


<p><em>Calendar module</em> was the most voted-for feature in mentioned <strong>Todoist</strong> application, because people want to integrate their TODO lists with calendars. But it fell on deaf ears for years now. This proxy allows to solve many problems in current situation and might act like a calendar extension for this application.</p>

    <h3>Step #2: Transform your calendar the same way</h3>
    <div class="form-group">
        <label for="url-calendar">URL of your iCalendar:</label>
        <input id="url-calendar" type="url" class="form-control monitored"/>

        <label>Your new URL:</label><br/>
        <pre id="calendar-generator-result-url"></pre>
    </div>

    <h3>Note about privacy</h3>

    <p>Calendars contain private data, and the service that acts like a proxy can technically process this data in any way, including malicious scenarios. If you don't want to entrust some 3rd party service with the sensitive stuff, it's fully understandable.</p>

    <p>While this web application does not do anything else than it promises, you don't have to trust it, but you can verify it. The source code is published on <a href="https://github.com/taurit/CalendarProxy">GItHub's Calendar Proxy project page</a>. If you have <strong>Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition</strong> or newer, you can easily build a project yourself with just a few clicks. If you have access to some IIS server or Azure subscription, you can also easily host your own trusted instance of this code. Also, I recommend to make sure that you access the page via HTTPS.</p>
